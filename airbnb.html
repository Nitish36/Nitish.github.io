                                Airbnb is a popular online marketplace that enables individuals to rent out their properties, whether it's a spare room,
                                 an entire home, or unique accommodations, to travelers seeking short-term lodging. Founded in 2008, Airbnb has revolutionized 
                                 the hospitality industry by providing a platform for hosts to list their properties and travelers to book accommodations that
                                  suit their preferences and budgets. The platform offers a wide range of options, from apartments and houses to treehouses 
                                  and yurts, in various locations worldwide. Users can browse listings, read reviews, communicate with hosts, and make 
                                  reservations directly through the Airbnb website or mobile app. This innovative concept has not only changed the way people
                                   travel but also opened up new income opportunities for property owners and hosts.

								 specific needs of the Airbnb project. These scripts were designed to fetch, process, and generate real-time data on crucial 
								 aspects, such as occupancy rates, pricing trends, and guest reviews.
                                Data Pipelines: Established data pipelines to ensure the continuous and automated collection of data from various sources.
								 These pipelines not only facilitated real-time data updates but also standardized the incoming data for consistency and 
								 accuracy.
