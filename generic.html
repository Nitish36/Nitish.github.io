							<h1 class="major">Brazilian Customer Analysis</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/brazil.png " /></span>
							<p>
								I conducted a comprehensive Brazilian customer analysis, utilizing datasets such as customer information, order details,
								 shipping freight, and order data. To analyze this data, I employed powerful data processing tools such as PySpark and
								  Pandas. Leveraging the capabilities of these libraries, I performed various analyses on the datasets, extracting valuable
								   insights and uncovering meaningful patterns. Through data manipulation, aggregation, and statistical calculations,
								    I gained a deep understanding of customer behavior, order trends, and shipping patterns. This analysis provided valuable
									 insights that can inform strategic decision-making, optimize business processes, and enhance customer satisfaction in 
									 the Brazilian market
							</p>
							<p>Various insights were generated from this some of which were as given below</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Based on the results obtained it can be seen the there is an increase in
									the number of orders placed from 4 to 324 and then dropped to a
									minimal of 1 in december</li>
								<li>From 2017 the number of orders shows a general increasing trend from
									January to November, with slight fluctuations in between.</li>
								<li>IN 2018 the number of orders starts high in January and remains
									relatively stable until May. After May,there is a decreasing trend in order
									volume.</li>
								<li>The highest number of purchases are from people who are there in São
									Paulo (SP) of Brazil and the least are from Roraima (RR).</li>
								<li>Most of the purchase are made in afternoon (38135) and the least no of
									purchases are made in the dawn (5242)</li>
								<li>monthly seasonality refers to the regular and predictable fluctuations in
									certain variables or phenomena that can be observed from one month to
									another.</li>
								<li>Also the highest count of products are for bed table bath and the least
									count of products are for cds music dvd</li>
								<li>Most of the people make use of credit cards for their purchases and 3 of
									them haven’t defined their payment which can be seen through the bar
									graphs</li>
								<li>The dataset sellers has the highest count of cities from Sao Paulo
									which means many people from Sao Paulo sell goods and the least count
									of sellers are from Piauí (PI), Manaus (AM), Acre (AC), Maranhão (MA)</li>
								<li>The count of customers to whom the products are delivered has the
									highest count 9678.</li>
								<li>The count of bed table bath products is the highest among all and it
									can be seen that more revenue is generated from it</li>
								<li>San Paulo has the highest number of seller cities which means that
									most of the selling of products takes place in San paulo. The conditions
									are favorable for profitable trade of products in San Paulo</li>
								<li>About 57328 orders have been given the highest rating of 5 which
									means the type of goods which are sent are of best value</li>
