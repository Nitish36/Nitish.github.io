								In the heart disease prediction project, I utilized Python programming language along with machine learning
                                 techniques to develop a model that predicts the likelihood of an individual developing heart disease. The goal 
                                 of the project was to create a tool that could assist healthcare professionals in early identification and 
                                 intervention for individuals at high risk.I gathered a comprehensive dataset comprising crucial medical parameters
                                  such as trestbps (resting blood pressure), cholostrol levels, blood pressure, gender, thalach (maximum heart rate
                                   achieved), glucose levels, and more. The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values, normalizing features,
                                    and performing necessary transformations to enhance the accuracy of the model.For this project, I employed two 
                                    machine learning models: Decision Tree and Linear Regression. These models were chosen due to their interpretability
                                     and ability to capture non-linear relationships within the data.By completing this heart disease prediction project
                                     , I demonstrated proficiency in Python programming, employed decision tree and linear regression models, and 
                                     utilized visualization tools like Tableau and Streamlit.
